# [WIP] GLWE - 2D OpenGL rendering engine optimzed to be compiled to WebAssembly
GLWE is a 2D *OpenGL* rendering engine written in *C++* that can be compiled for Desktop devices or to WebAssembly with [Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten).
The current demo can be downloaded [here](paste).
## Current features
